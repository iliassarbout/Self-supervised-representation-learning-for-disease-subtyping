# Description

This repository shares a school work on disease subtyping with OMICS data.

In this project we implement a gaussian mixture VAE with SNIS (self normalized importance sampling) estimator of Forward KL divergence. We compare the results with subtype gan, a SOTA model in disease subtyping, as well as gaussian mixture VAE and original modification of it.

This repository contains an original pytorch implementation of Subtype-Gan and other models used in this project.
